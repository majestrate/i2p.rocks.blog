Title: REJOICE, opentracker.i2p.rocks capacity increased
Authors: jeff

REJOICE, I have increased the number of threads handling udp traffic from 8 to 16 to deal with a recent increase in traffic.

As a result the tracker software was restart. Probably could have SIGHUP'd it but meh.

This tracker is my personal zen garden type hobby.

You can see traffic stats on the front page of the open tracker [here](https://opentracker.i2p.rocks).

Packets go brrrrrrr haha.
